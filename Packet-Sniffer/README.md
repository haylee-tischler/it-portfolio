# Packet Sniffer

## Project Overview

The Packet Sniffer project is a network analysis tool that captures and inspects live network traffic. It demonstrates the fundamentals of packet capture, filtering, and analysis, showcasing a hands‑on understanding of network protocols and cybersecurity concepts.

This project was built as part of my cybersecurity portfolio to highlight skills in Python programming, network analysis, and ethical hacking practices.

## Features

- Captures live network traffic from a specified network interface

- Filters packets by protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

- Displays detailed packet headers and payload information

- Logs captured packets to a file for later analysis

- Works in real-time with terminal output

## Technologies / Tools Used

- Python 3.x

- socket module (for raw socket packet capture)

- Optional: scapy (if used for further parsing or convenience)

- Linux (raw sockets often require root privileges on Linux)

## Learning Outcomes / Skills Demonstrated

- Understanding of network layers and protocols (IP, TCP/UDP, ICMP)

- Experience in capturing and analyzing raw network packets

- Practical knowledge of Python networking libraries / raw sockets

- Ethical awareness of safe network testing practices
